Basketball game where there are two hoops and its one guy that shoots.

*two hoops that have colliders and physics

*slider that shows how hard your player is going to shoot the ball

*many animations such as dribbling the basketball when in hand and shooting and idling

*every shot you make depending on how far you are it will measure the px and divide it by 125 to get the number of coins.

*you can add accesories with the coins

*there is no competition you just shoot baskets for FUN!

*when you make a basket it makes a cheering sound 

*when you miss and the basketball hits the ground its teleports to your hand in 2 seconds.

*the ground has to have physics so if you miss it starts bouncing then when it stops it teleports to your hand.
